"""Check a trained model against this project before using it.

Models trained with model-trainer come as a package: weights plus `model_card.json` (classes in order,
image size, scores, dataset fingerprint). A model whose classes differ from the catalogue would report
wrong part names, so the class list is checked when the models are loaded.
